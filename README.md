RULES of Hooks:

1. React Hooks canâ€™t be used outside react component

2. Two versions of React should never mix

3. Order of execution of the hooks should never change.That is you should never put the hooks under any if-condition or any loops as the hook will be deleted if the cndtion fails which is always be tracked by react .

15.)create ErrorBoundary.js in components folder.create errorboundary class component that returns some jsx if error occurs else renders the actual child component using getDerivedStateFromError method of component class.

Note:
THree levels of errorboundary:

1.)return null if the component is loew priority

2.)return with some jsx if the component is not high priority

3.)return with the developer details if the component if high priority.
